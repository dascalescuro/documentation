## Editing Video Data

Once the upload process has started, you can edit the file's metadata. 
You can find various editing options in the right pane.

To edit video data:

* Select the desired video in the video list by clicking on the appropriate entry. You can search for the video you want using the search function. There is a video preview in the right pane of the window, as well as all data on the selected video. Here you can make changes as needed.

* In the accordion menu Metadata you can change the following settings:

        video title
        description
        keywords
        person in charge

* There may be more metadata fields that were added by your administrator; you can edit these as well.


* In the Security accordion menu you have the following options:

        video release (also time-controlled)
        download release
        time-controlled deletion
        security settings

You can only release a video once conversion of the 360p format is complete.


* All standard formats of a video are displayed in the Video Formats accordion menu. Here, you can download any format by clicking on the corresponding [Download] button.

> Downloading is available only if you have already released the video for download (see Releasing a Video for Download).
