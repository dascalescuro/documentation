# Uploading a video



To upload a video from your local directory, follow these steps:

* Click on the [Upload] button in the actions toolbar. The window for the selection of a video file opens.

* Select the desired video file, and then click on the [Open] button. The upload process is started. 
On the basis of the progress bar, you can trace the process.

* Alternatively, you can add a video to the video list by drag & drop. 
To do this, select the desired file in your local directory and drag it while holding the left mouse button in the video list pane. 
The upload process starts when you release the mouse button.
