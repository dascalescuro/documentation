# Publishing a Video

Once you have all the data of the uploaded video edited according to your needs and set the startup screen, you can publish it.

> :warning: To publish a video, it must be previously released (see "Editing Video Data").

1. Open the accordion menu Publish.

2. In the drop down menu, select the desired player. 
The selection list provides individually created players in addition to the standard players 
(for more information, see chapter [Player Generator]()).

3. If you first want to look at the video, just copy the preview URL and enter this in the address bar of your browser. The video will now play.

4. For the integration of the video, you can easily copy the HTML code or the URL and then place it for your website as you want.
