# Define Roles


First, set the roles with appropriate privileges. Next, user accounts can be created and assigned to these roles.

Highlight the entry "Roles" in the navigation. Should roles are already set, they appear in the list of all roles.

If you want to edit one of the existing roles, select the corresponding entry and then edit it as desired in the editing field.

To create a new role, click on the [Create]-button.

Enter the role name in the text box provided and then click on the button [Create]. The corresponding role is created and appears in the list of roles.

Now, mark the new entry in the list of roles.

Make the following settings in the right pane:

* role name 
* role description 
* role rights: activate rights to be assigned to this role.

> By default, no rights are assigned to a newly created role.
