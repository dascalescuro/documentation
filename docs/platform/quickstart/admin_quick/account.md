# Account overview

In the Administration area, an overview provides all current information about your account:

* Monthly traffic
* Video storage (in minutes)
* Users
* Groups (this information appears only if you have booked the feature "Ownership")

> The overview shows each value currently used against the capacity you booked. 
With color marking, you can see when you might need an additional booking.
