# Creating and editing users

## Create a user



To create a new user, follow these steps:

* Click on the [Create] button in the action toolbar. 

* Enter the e-mail address of the user. 

* If user roles are already defined, you can select the desired from the drop-down menu. But you have also the opportunity to define roles and assign them to the user in the follow-up (see chapter "Roles").

* Select from the corresponding drop-down menu the user's language. The confirmation e-mail to the new user will be sent in the language of your choice.

* Activate the check box "Send confirmation to user". The recipient receives an e-mail with an activation link.

* Click on the button [Create user], to create the user. The entry will appear immediately in the list of users. 

## Editing a User

* Mark the entry of the user that you want to edit in the user list.

* Change the following optional settings for the user data:

- language
- first name, last name
- phone
- company.

> The initial email provided for a user cannot be changed.

* In group management, you can assign roles to this user. For this purpose, navigate to the group management by clicking on the entry "Groups" first. Here, the group "Company" is created by default, where you can assign roles to users.

* All created users are listed under the menu Members and roles.  First go to the user record that you want to edit. All previously assigned roles are displayed under the user name.

* To assign a role to the user, click the "+" icon. This opens the selection box where you can select a role.

* Confirm your selection by the tick icon. Add more roles as described to this user as needed.

* You also have the option to remove any user assigned roles. To do this, click the "x" icon of the appropriate role.
