# Searching for Videos


Description

You can use the VMPro's search function to search for specific videos by video titles, IDs, descriptions, chapters and overlays.

You can use the basic search function, or you can add filters to further refine your search.

Searches and filters can now contain special characters, such as "@", "#", "!".

As well, the search function is no longer case-sensitive.
Basic Search

To search for a video, simply enter a search term in the video toolbar. The results will be displayed in the video list.
Search by channel name

You can also search for videos using by channel name. If you enter the channel name in the search bar, you will be shown videos from that channel. As well, other relevant videos based on the metadata will be displayed in the results.
Search by filename

You can also search for a video by using its original filename. Sometimes, a video may have been renamed; you can search for this video using its original filename.

Note that the file name may not always correspond to the video's current title. You can find the filename in the metadata section of the video.

If the video title is now "Example Video" but its filename is "example_video", you will be shown the desired video when you search for "example_video".
Filters

Filtering can be done by title, description or uploader. You can also use substrings (parts of a word or phrase) in your search query.

1. To set up a filter, click on the the [Add Filter] button.
2. Choose the filter type you would like to create.
3. In the filter edit area, enter your keywords for the video into the field. You can further refine your search results by using multiple filter fields or filter types.
